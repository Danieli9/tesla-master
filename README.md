# Method Base Theme

![Method Base Theme Banner](https://tesladesignstudio.com/tesla-cover.png)

Tesla is a base theme designed to facilitate custom theme-building at an accelerated pace, without sacrificing code efficiency or site performance. The theme uses Twitter's Bootstrap 5 framework as the foundation for building the frontend.

This theme was designed for building fully-customized solutions and is not intended to be a turn-key solution. Especially in regards to the frontend, Tesla essentially provides you with a blank slate to efficiently build from. This theme is an optimal fit for projects that heavily utilize custom post meta and theme options (whether through theme mods or custom options) since it is specifically designed to reduce the number of database queries necessary to utilize such data. Tesla was originally built to facilitate a workflow where preapproved design comps are converted into a functioning theme.
