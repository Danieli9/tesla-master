Tesla Theme is a foundational theme specifically crafted to expedite the process of custom theme-building, while maintaining exceptional code efficiency and site performance. Leveraging Twitter's Bootstrap 5 framework, this theme serves as a robust frontend framework.

Tesla Theme is tailored for developing fully-customized solutions, prioritizing flexibility over turn-key functionality. Particularly on the frontend, it offers a clean canvas for efficient and seamless customization. The theme excels in projects that heavily rely on custom post meta and theme options, whether through theme modifications or custom configurations, thanks to its optimized design that minimizes the number of necessary database queries. Originally, Tesla Theme was created to streamline the conversion of preapproved design comps into fully functional themes.
